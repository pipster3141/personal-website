Create overall "card" theme
Experience
Education
Projects (Make them in the shape of cards)
Skills
Footer

Keep Education as the media object
theme but make bubbles underneath for different
classes taken.
Or possibly make education media objects that look
similar to what it looks like now.
Mostly rectangular with bubbles inside for the classes.

Don't display the bars for skills under the about me
but instead have a button for it under the text bubble.
When the button is pressed shove the text to the left
and animate the bars spawning on the right to what it
currently looks like.

Make the header look more responsive when hovering
over a nav link.

Text is stupid in about me "welcome to my port" fix it.
